## Software

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).


Windows        |   Mac OS  X   |      Linux
---------------|---------------|---------------
Install R by downloading and running [this .exe](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) file from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Please also install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).| Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) file from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Please also install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).|You can download the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Please also install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop)

**Packages we will be using:** We recommend you install these ahead of time and ensure they load correctly to reduce troubleshooting in the workshop. 


## Other workshops: EDIT THIS SECTION/UPDATE

If you enjoyed this workshop and were interested in learning more, we have also run workshops on

  * [How to improve the reproducibility and efficiency of your coding for ecology and evolution (FastR)](https://github.com/afilazzola/FastR)

Additionally, Alex has run these workshops:

  * [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/afilazzola/CUELogisticRegression)
  * [Introduction to Ecological Analyses](https://afilazzola.github.io/UoA.CommunityAnalyses.2018/)
  * [Introduction to Functions](https://afilazzola.github.io/Intro2Functions/)

You can find similar style workshops, usually that are longer and go into more detail, with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/). They have teachers available globally and cover all forms of programming beyond R.
